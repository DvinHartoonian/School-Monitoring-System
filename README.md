# School-Monitoring-System

A program written in Java that utilises a Java Swing GUI to allow teachers to input data they collected when monitoring classrooms.
The inputted data is then sent and stored in the school database using SQL queries.
The teachers can also use this program to output the collected data from the database as Pie charts, Bar charts and Spreadsheets, full with customisable elements.

This program was originally written for my A Level Computer Science NEA and my client was a teacher from William Perkin CofE High School.

Final build was made in 5/11/2020.
